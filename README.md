# LeetCode Journey by MrCopper

Welcome to my LeetCode Journey! This is a self-learning project where I solve LeetCode problems to improve my algorithmic thinking and coding skills — one problem at a time.

Each problem is categorized by difficulty: `Easy`, `Medium`, or `Hard`, and includes multiple solutions if applicable (e.g. brute force, optimized, hashmap, etc.)

## Categories

| Difficulty | Description | Problems |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 🟢 Easy    | Basic level questions for warm-up | [View Easy Problems](./Easy/README.md) |
| 🟡 Medium  | Intermediate problems requiring deeper insight | [View Medium Problems](./Medium/README.md) |
| 🔴 Hard    | Advanced problems that push my limits | [View Hard Problems](./Hard/README.md) |

## My Goals

- Practice consistently, even just 1 problem a day.
- Apply multiple approaches to the same problem.
- Document my thinking process clearly.
- Build this into a complete showcase of my growth.
